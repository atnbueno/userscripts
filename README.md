# atnbueno/userscripts

A collection of userscripts, designed to enhance websites with small, focused customizations. These scripts are compatible with modern userscript managers like [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), and the [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/app/userscripts/id1463298887) extension on macOS/iOS/iPadOS.

## Available Scripts

### [Feedback Assistant Helper](https://github.com/atnbueno/userscripts/raw/refs/heads/main/feedback-assistant-helper.user.js)

**Enhances the web version of the [Apple Feedback Assistant](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/)** by adding a download link to each report that lets you export full data and metadata as a JSON file, including:

- Report details
- Form response data
- Follow-ups
- Internal resolution status (if available)

It also provides on-page notifications to indicate progress and errors.

This userscript is complemented with a shortcut that converts those JSON reports to Markdown using a customizable template:  
`[link TBA]`
