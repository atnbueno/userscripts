# atnbueno/userscripts

A collection of userscripts, designed to enhance websites with small, focused customizations. These scripts are compatible with modern userscript managers like [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), and the [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/app/userscripts/id1463298887) extension on macOS/iOS/iPadOS.

## Available Scripts

### Feedback Assistant Helper

**Enhances the web version of the [Apple Feedback Assistant](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/)** by converting the feedback ID (e.g., `FB12345678`) at the top of the report into a link that lets you download full report data (as JSON), including:

- Report details
- Form response data
- Follow-ups
- Resolution status (if available)

It also provides on-page notifications for progress and errors, and handles dynamic navigation automatically.

**Note:** Due to macOS Safari security restrictions this userscript doesn't work, but it will work with any other browser that supports the **Violentmonkey** extension (see below)

This userscript pairs well with this shortcut that converts JSON reports into Markdown using a customizable template:
